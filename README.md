# Store input numbers:  
num1 = input('Enter first number: ')  
num2 = input('Enter second number: ')  
  
# Add two numbers  
sum = float(num1) + float(num2)  
# Subtract two numbers  
min = float(num1) - float(num2)  
# Multiply two numbers  
mul = float(num1) * float(num2)   
# Display the sum  
print('The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, sum))  
  
# Display the subtraction  
print('The subtraction of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, min))  
# Display the multiplication  
print('The multiplication of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, mul))
